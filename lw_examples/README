These examples are based on those of the excellent tutorial learn-wgpu.
They just want to be a way for me to understand how to create a framework that is as transparent and user-friendly as possible.
If you want to learn wgpu I recommend going to [the official learn-wgpu tutorial site](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).
