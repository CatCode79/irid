# Irid Game Framework
(Disclaimer: This project is to be considered in the "draft phase" and therefore not yet usable)

## Planned Features
- PBR Rendering (with ray-traced shadows)
- Some procedural generation for 3D models (simplified blender geometry nodes)
- Native support first, major consoles after (no web support planned at the moment)

## Major Dependencies
- [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)
- [naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga)
- [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

# lw_examples
Simple use case examples based on the learn-wgpu tutorial created with the irid framework


These examples are based on those of the excellent tutorial learn-wgpu.
They just want to be a way for me to understand how to create a framework that is as transparent and user-friendly as possible.
If you want to learn wgpu I recommend going to [the official learn-wgpu tutorial site](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).
