# Irid Game Framework
Because for my videogame I use [rend3](https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3) this project has become a toy to learn the [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) graphics library and other libraries I'm considering using, I don't know if the framework will evolve into something broader.
It is however likely that when the wgpu will support the API for raytracing I will play around a bit, in the meantime I will slowly add various examples.

## Major Dependencies
- [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) - Safe and portable GPU abstraction
- [naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga) - Universal shader translator
- [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) - Window handling library
- [yakui](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/yakui) - Declarative UI library for games (I'll add it soon)

## Examples
Simple use case examples based on the learn-wgpu tutorial created with the irid framework.

These examples are based on those of the excellent tutorial learn-wgpu.
They just want to be a way for me to understand how to create a framework that is as transparent and user-friendly as possible.
If you want to learn wgpu I recommend going to the [learn-wgpu tutorial site](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).
